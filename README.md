# -IC_50_Logistic_regression_project
A simple programme to determine a compounds IC50 using it's smiles against the CHEMBL database
This module predicts a compounds IC50 from an input smiles string using logistic regression.
The data preparation steps have been adapted from: 'https://github.com/dataprofessor/bioinformatics_freecodecamp/blob/main/CDD_ML_Part_1_Acetylcholinesterase_Bioactivity_Data_Concised.ipynb'
The training set used must be for the same biological target as the query.
To run execute:
'python3 IC_50_fingerprint_logistic_regression.py'
